# MVC and PHP OOP Example

**Description:**

A practice example of the MVC Design Pattern and OOP in PHP. 

Use this code example to create your own PHP application that connects to MySQL and queries data from a table.

This example uses the freely available for download "world" database. You will need to download and import it into your MySQL server. You can download the "world" database and other free databases [here](https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2020/02/15/mysql-download-sample-database-sakila-world-employee/).

This is a simple application example. Use it as a code playground to implement your own classes, objects, properties and methods.
